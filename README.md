# TwoStageStochasticBlock

SMS++ Block for two-stage stochastic programming problems.

The `TwoStageStochasticBlock` is a `:Block` that represents a two-stage
stochastic programming problem contained in its inner `Block`. It builds
the explicit form of a two-stage stochastic problem by:

- creating N copies of the inner deterministic `Block` (one per scenario)

- adding non-anticipativity constraints to ensure first-stage variables
  are the same across all scenarios

- combining objectives weighted by probabilities.

TODO: We need `Objective::scale()` to be implemented. Currently we have a
workaround for `LinearFunction` objectives (like those of
`CapacitatedFacilityLocationBlock` or `UCBlock`) that should be replaced.

The class uses serialization/deserialization to create copies of the inner
`Block`, which works for all `Block` types without requiring them to implement
any special copy methods. The inner `Block` is serialized once and then
deserialized N times to create independent copies for each scenario.

Scenario data is applied automatically when a `ScenarioGenerator` is provided,
either through deserialization (when a `ScenarioSet` is present in the netCDF)
or by explicitly setting one via `set_scenario_generator()`. The class uses
the `StochasticBlock` as a temporary "applicator" for scenarios: it sets each
Block copy as the inner block of `StochasticBlock`, applies the scenario data
through the `StochasticBlock::set_data()` method (which uses the
`DataMappings`), then restores the original inner `Block`. This approach
eliminates the need for `DataMapping::set_caller()` and provides a cleaner
architecture.


## Getting started

These instructions will let you build TwoStageStochasticBlock on your system.

### Requirements

- [SMS++ StochasticBlock](https://gitlab.com/smspp/stochasticblock).
  which in turn requires the "core SMS++"

### Build and install with CMake

Configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
cmake --install .
```

### Usage with CMake

After the library is built, you can use it in your CMake project with:

```cmake
find_package(TwoStageStochasticBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++::TwoStageStochasticBlock)
```

### Build and install with makefiles

Carefully hand-crafted makefiles have also been developed for those unwilling
to use CMake. Makefiles build the executable in-source (in the same directory
tree where the code is) as opposed to out-of-source (in the copy of the
directory tree constructed in the build/ folder) and therefore it is more
convenient when having to recompile often, such as when developing/debugging
a new module, as opposed to the compile-and-forget usage envisioned by CMake.

Each executable using `TwoStageStochasticBlock` has to include a "main
makefile" of the module, which typically is either [makefile-c](makefile-c)
including all necessary libraries comprised the "core SMS++" one, or
[makefile-s](makefile-s) including all necessary libraries but not the "core
SMS++" one (for the common case in which this is used together with other
modules that already include them). A televant exampl is the
[tssb_solver](hhttps://gitlab.com/smspp/tools/-/blob/develop/tssb_solver/tssb_solver.cpp?ref_type=heads) available in the
[tools](https://gitlab.com/smspp/tools) repository. The makefiles in turn
recursively include all the required other makefiles, hence one should only
need to edit the "main makefile" for compilation type (C++ compiler and its
options) and it all should be good to go. In case some of the external
libraries (say, StOpt) are not at their default location, it should only be
necessary to create the `../extlib/makefile-paths` out of the
`extlib/makefile-default-paths-*` for your OS `*` and edit the relevant bits
(commenting out all the rest).

Check the [SMS++ installation wiki](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration#location-of-required-libraries)
for further details.
